On Debugging
\\- important in practice, 25 - 60\% of time \todo{source}
\\- difficult
\\- expensive

\section{50 Years of Debugging Research are Barely Used in Practice}

On history
\\- long history of research and relevance
\\- fig history
\\- Much research on debugging techniques in past 50 years
\\- Little of it is used in practice
\\- no1 is IDE-integrated symbolic debugger
\\- Omniscient debugging is great, but has horrible performance
\\- Other tools do not integrate well into debugging workflow
\todo{chart: history}


\section{Additional Challenges in Enterprise Applications}

Most debugging tools for one system
\\- EA 3-tier architecture
\\- Best tools in app layer
\\- trend: HTML5/JS, better tools here too
\\- trend: more code into database
\\- tools still lacking

\section{Research Questions \& Contributions}

How can debugging be improved to reduce the time needed to find a bug?
\\- How can developers efficiently navigate a program execution?
\\- How can the debugger help to identify relevant code?
\\- How can programs handling large amounts of data be debugged and analyzed efficiently?

A better way to track failure causes
\\- Improved existing program analysis technique 
\\- Seamless integration into debugging workflow
\\- Allows more efficient debugging by increasing focus, providing more relevant information, and reducing tool-related interruptions

Efficient omniscient debugging in the database
\\- Fully featured ODB with little overhead on performance and memory
\\- Query past database states
\\- Query changes in the database
